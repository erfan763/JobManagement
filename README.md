# JobManagement

A lightweight, extensible, and database-agnostic Job Management library for .NET applications.

> This package provides job abstractions and an engine that can be integrated into your application.  
> Persistence is **not** bundled (no SQL/Mongo/Redis by default) — you can store job data in your own database.

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package JobManagement --version 0.0.1
